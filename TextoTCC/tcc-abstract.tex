Containerization is a very useful tool when dealing with projects that require different dependencies or programs that may conflict with each other, require a lot of initial configuring, or demand portability. This made it perfect for robotics projects, but the impacts of its usage and quirks in real scenarios are still undocumented, which is what this project aims to do. The project will have 2 parts, the first will be an assessment of the performance of a simulation using Gazebo, and the second part will be an assessment of the performance of a real turtlebot.

Keywords: Robotics, ROS, Docker, Containerization
